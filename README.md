# DFS-Project
Personal Project for a Daily Fantasy Football Web App.

#Introduction:

This DFS app long term will be a full featured Fantasy Football web application. It has been created for a group of friends that I have enjoyed standard fantasy football with, and have decided that I want to expand into a different type of Fantasy Football League. 

#Features:

1) Webscraping: To get weekly point totals for each player selected
  * Challenges: interacting with APIs in order to get data & images then creating a database to store both current, and historical data. 

2) Weekly Scoring: Having a website score things is not new, this application will automatically take the user choices and translate those selections into a point total. This will be the prelude to a historical score board, a 'rating' of those choices and other various tools that are currently in other applications.
  * Challenges: Weekly Scoring will involve creating user specific dashboard with customized data, as well as a general leaderboard with the ability to sort scoring by user, by player, by year, etc.

3) *Potential Feature* Intigrated chat client.
  * Challenges: Creating & maintaining a chat client that ties into user credentials and is real-time. 

#Tech Stack:

Front End: React/Redux/MaterialUI/Typescript*
Back End: Python/Flask/Postgres


*Potentially will add.

#Timeframe:

The Current Time Frame for Phase one of this project is Q1/Q2 2021.
