# DFS-Project
Personal Project for a Daily Fantasy Football Web App.

#Introduction

This DFS app long term will be a full featured Fantasy Football web application. It has been created for a group of friends that I have enjoyed standard fantasy football with, and have decided that I want to expand into a different type of Fantasy Football League. 

#Features:
Webscraping - To get weekly point totals for each player selected
  - Challenges involved: interacting with APIs in order to get data & images then creating a database to store both current, and historical data. 
Weekly Scoring - Having a website score things is not new, this application will automatically take the user choices and translate those selections into a point total. This will                    be the prelude to a historical score board, a 'rating' of those choices and other various tools that are currently in other applications.
